/* 
========================================
PRODUCT DATA STRUCTURE
========================================

We are creating a products array.
This acts like our database (since no backend allowed).

Each product is an OBJECT.
All objects are stored inside an ARRAY.

Why?
Because:
- We can loop through array
- Filter it
- Sort it
- Search inside it
- Dynamically display products
